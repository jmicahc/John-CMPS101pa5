Subjected Programgs:
    list.c -
        an abstract data structure that implements a set of
        access and maniuplation functions build around the
        abstraction of an integer sequence with at most one 
        highlighted integer.
  
    Graph.c -
        An abstract data structure that implements an
        adjacency list representation of a graph. Contains a
        Breadth-First search function and other functions for
        detecting properties of graphs.

    GraphTest.c -
        A test Client for the Graph ADT.

    GraphClient.c -
        Another Test Cleint for the Graph ADT.

    FindPath.c -
        A program that reads in an input file representing a graph and
        builds an adjacency list representation using the Graph ADT. The
        input file also specifies a sequence of start and end vertices,
        for which the program prints the distance and a step-by-step path.

    Makefile -
        Standard unix makefile. See file for instructions
        on how to use.
